# The tale project - When will your friends arrive? ("They are late, eh?")
### The Idea
Usually when you meet up with friends somebody will arrive late.
This can be kind of annoying especially if you're the guy always
arriving first.

We want to help you: Our app provides groups for different meetups
and telling you by the ETA of your friends who is the last to arrive.
You can then adjust what you want to do depending on your latest
friend. E.g. grep a coffee and then arrive together with him.
